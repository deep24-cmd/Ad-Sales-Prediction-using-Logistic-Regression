# Ad-Sales-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

Advertisement Sale Prediction using Logistic Regression
**Project Description**

This project predicts whether an existing customer will purchase a product after seeing an advertisement, based on their Age and Estimated Salary.
The prediction is made using a Logistic Regression machine learning model, which is well-suited for binary classification problems.

**The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline including:**

Data loading

Feature scaling

Model training

Prediction

Model evaluation

**🚀 Features**

Binary classification using Logistic Regression

User input prediction (Age & Salary)

Train-Test data splitting

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score

Fully compatible with VS Code / Local Python Environment

**🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm**

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used to predict categorical outcomes.
In this project, it predicts:

1 → Customer will buy

0 → Customer will not buy

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn
